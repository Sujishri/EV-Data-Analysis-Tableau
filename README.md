# EV-Data-Analysis-Tableau




# Goal of the Project:
The aim of this project is to create an interactive and insightful Tableau dashboard to analyze the electric vehicle (EV) market. This dashboard will help stakeholders assess key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the overall landscape of electric vehicles, technological advancements in EV ranges, and the market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

By developing this dashboard, the project seeks to:

+ Understand Market Trends:   Provide insights into the total number of electric vehicles, enabling stakeholders to gauge the market's size and growth.

+ Evaluate Technological Progress:   Track and analyze the average electric range of EVs to measure advancements in battery technology and vehicle efficiency.

+ Compare BEVs and PHEVs:   Help stakeholders understand the relative market shares of BEVs and PHEVs, offering insight into the dominance of different EV technologies.
+ Monitor Industry Performance:   Empower decision-makers to assess the market dynamics and identify opportunities for further development in the EV sector.


# Process:
1. Understanding Requirements:
 
+ Review the problem statement and the dataset containing electric vehicle information.
+ Identify key KPIs such as total number of vehicles, average electric range, percentage of BEVs and PHEVs, and the distribution between BEV and PHEV vehicles.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   
+ Load the provided CSV file into Tableau.
+ Clean the data by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a usable format.
+ Create calculated fields if necessary, such as calculating the percentage of BEVs and PHEVs relative to the total EVs.

3. Dashboard Design:

+ Determine the most suitable visualizations to represent KPIs:
+ Total Vehicles: A simple count of all EVs.
+ Average Electric Range: A bar or line chart showing trends in the range over time or by model.
+ Total BEVs and PHEVs: Separate sections for BEVs and PHEVs, using pie charts or bar charts to show the distribution.
+ Design an intuitive layout for the dashboard with filters and interactive elements to allow users to explore the data based on vehicle type, year, or region.

4. Data Visualization in Tableau:

+ Total Vehicles: Create a summary visualization showing the total number of electric vehicles.
+ Average Electric Range: Use a bar or line chart to represent the average electric range of vehicles across different models or years.
+ Total BEV and % of Total BEV: Use a bar chart or KPI metric to show the total BEVs and calculate their percentage out of the total EVs.
+ Total PHEV and % of Total PHEV: Similarly, visualize PHEVs and their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles.

5. Dashboard Development:
  
+ Assemble the individual visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.
+ Implement interactive filters for categories like vehicle type (BEV or PHEV), year of release, and vehicle range.
+ Add dynamic tooltips to display additional information when hovering over charts.
  
6. Dashboard Testing:

+ Review the dashboard for accuracy in calculations, consistency, and user experience.
+ Ensure that all filters and interactions are working as intended.
+ Get feedback from stakeholders to refine the design.
  
8. Dashboard Publication:
   
+ Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public or Tableau Server, ensuring that all stakeholders can access it easily.
+ Test the published dashboard to ensure it retains interactivity and visual appeal in the online version.
