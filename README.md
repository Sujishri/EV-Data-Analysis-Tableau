# EV-Data-Analysis-Tableau




# Goal of the Project:
The aim of this project is to create an interactive and insightful Tableau dashboard to analyze the electric vehicle (EV) market. This dashboard will help stakeholders assess key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the overall landscape of electric vehicles, technological advancements in EV ranges, and the market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

By developing this dashboard, the project seeks to:

1.Understand Market Trends: Provide insights into the total number of electric vehicles, enabling stakeholders to gauge the market's size and growth.

2.Evaluate Technological Progress: Track and analyze the average electric range of EVs to measure advancements in battery technology and vehicle efficiency.

3.Compare BEVs and PHEVs: Help stakeholders understand the relative market shares of BEVs and PHEVs, offering insight into the dominance of different EV technologies.

4.Monitor Industry Performance: Empower decision-makers to assess the market dynamics and identify opportunities for further development in the EV sector.


# Process:
1. Understanding Requirements:
 
+ Review the problem statement and the dataset containing electric vehicle information.
+ Identify key KPIs such as total number of vehicles, average electric range, percentage of BEVs and PHEVs, and the distribution between BEV and PHEV vehicles.
3. Data Preprocessing:
Load the provided CSV file into Tableau.
Clean the data by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a usable format.
Create calculated fields if necessary, such as calculating the percentage of BEVs and PHEVs relative to the total EVs.
